# Request Header Parser Microservice
A Request Header Parser Microservice is a small web service or application designed to parse and analyze HTTP request headers sent by clients (typically web browsers or other HTTP clients). When a client makes an HTTP request to a server, it includes various headers that provide information about the request, the client, and the communication preferences
